# Sentiment-Analysis-
It refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.

Here, we have taken sample statement for doing sentiment analysis on it. Firstly, there is a need to check how many positive and negative words are present in a given statement after that we need to give sentiment score to those particular words i.e. 1 for positive, -1 for negative and 0 for neutral after assigning the score we need to get the total score of that statement which decides whether the given statement is positive, negative or neutral statement. In the same way we can do on article.
